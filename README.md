# Elasticsearch for MODX (in development)

An event driven Elasticsearch extra for MODX wrapping around the Elasticsearch PHP SDK. Still very much in development and **not recommended for production use** (yet). Designed to be similar to SimpleSearch, but offer more features and customization.

[See the documentation for more details](https://poconosewandvac.github.io/Elasticsearch/).

## Developing

Run `composer install` in `core/components/elasticsearch` to download the dependencies. Uses MODX Git Package Management for building and updating the package.
